OP-TEE Device Tree Bindings

OP-TEE is a piece of software using hardware features to provide a Trusted
Execution Environment. The security can be provided with ARM TrustZone, but
also by virtualization or a separate chip. As there's no single OP-TEE
vendor we're using "optee" as the first part of compatible property,
indicating the OP-TEE protocol is used when communicating with the secure
world.

* OP-TEE based on ARM TrustZone required properties:

- compatible="optee,optee-tz"

Example:
	optee {
		compatible="optee,optee-tz";
	};
